Consider a hypothetical health tech company, BeHealthy, which aims to connect medical communities with millions of patients through a web platform. The platform enables doctors to list their services, manage patient interactions, and provide services such as booking appointments and ordering medicines online. Using this platform, doctors can easily organize appointments, track a patient’s past medical records, and provide e-prescriptions. 

Companies like BeHealthy generate large volumes of data by providing medical services, prescriptions, and online consultations. Let’s take a look at the following snippet of medical data that may be generated when a doctor writes notes to their patient or prepares reviews of their patient.

 

“The patient was a 62-year-old man with squamous cell lung cancer, which was first successfully treated by a combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.”

 

As you can observe, a person with a non-medical background may not understand the various medical terms used in the text. We have taken a simple sentence from a medical data set to understand the problem. Here, you can understand the meaning of the terms “cancer” and “chemotherapy.” 


Suppose you have been asked to identify a disease name and its possible treatment from a given data set and list it out in a table or a dictionary like this.



 

After analyzing the problem given above, you must build a custom NER to get the list of diseases and their treatment from the data set. Let’s first download the data set given below.


Note: You are required to complete the assignment on the Google Collab notebook, so you need to download the data set and then upload it to the required Google Drive folder to read it in your respective notebook.
